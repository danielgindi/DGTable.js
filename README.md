DGTable.js
==========

This is a table View for Backbone + jQuery, which is meant to be high-performance, and allow simple user interactions with the UI, such as:
* Sorting
* Sorting by more than one column
* Moving columns
* Resizing columns

Other features implemented are:
* Mix absolute column widths with relative column widths
* Virtual table mode (to supply high performance with hundreds of thousands of rows). This is the default.
* Non-virtual table mode is fully supported, but for giant amounts of data it is not recommended.
* Option to set a fixed width for the table so resizing (relative) columns will still make sure the table will not be less (and/or more) than the specified width.

A few notes:
* TODO: Handle row height correctly when rows have different height in virtual mode.
* TODO: Take care of scrollbars when table is fixed width and columns overflow it
* TODO: Show the full data of the cell when hovering (or touching), in case of the cell overflowing.
* TODO: Take care of vertical scrollbar location bug in IE
* TODO: When the width of a fixed column is increased for sort-arrow, re-calculate the relative sizes of the other columns

## Dev environment

* Using grunt over Node.js to automate validating and building.
* After installing Node.js, use `npm install`, and `npm install -g grunt-cli` to prepare building environment.
* Use `grunt style` to just test for correct styling.
* Use `grunt build` or just `grunt` to compile for release.
* I am using Google Closure Compiler, because UglifyJS does not work with the JSDoc, and there's a major difference in size & performance of the output code.
* Some features of jshint are disabled because it does not work well with JSDoc which is used for Google Closue Compiler.
* Indentations in my editor are set to 4 spaces, and jshint validates that.
