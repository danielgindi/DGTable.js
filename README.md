DGTable.js
==========

This is a table View for Backbone + jQuery, which is meant to be high-performance, and allow simple user interactions with the UI, such as:
* Sorting
* Sorting by more than one column
* Moving columns
* Resizing columns
* Virtual table mode (to supply high performance with hundreds of thousands of rows)

A few notes:
* TODO: Handle row height correctly when rows have different height in virtual mode.
* TODO: Full support for non-virtual table mode.
